  It provides a Web based screen display running on WPE WebKit. Contrary to
  other solutions, this project runs the browser on the top of a Wayland
  compositor. WPE WebKit allows embedders to create simple and performant
  systems based on Web platform technologies. It is a WebKit port designed with
  flexibility and hardware acceleration in mind, leveraging common 3D graphics
  APIs for best performance.

  **Project Status: No Longer Under Active Development**

  This project was an experiment to integrate WPE into the Balena Hub.
  It is not currently actively developed or maintained.  The current
  version available from Balena Hub does not reflect the most recent
  advancements or patches in the WPE ecosystem.

  If an up to date Balena block is very important to you, we'd be very
  interested to hear more.  Meanwhile, if you encounter issues or are
  seeking updates, we recommend exploring alternative solutions or resources
  that align with your requirements.

  Should you have any further questions or inquiries, please feel free to
  get in touch.
