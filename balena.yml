  PROJECT STATUS: NO LONGER UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.

  This project was an experiment to integrate WPE into the Balena Hub.
  It is not currently actively developed or maintained.  The current
  version available from Balena Hub does not reflect the most recent
  advancements or patches in the WPE ecosystem.

  If an up to date Balena block is very important to you, we'd be very
  interested to hear more.  Meanwhile, if you encounter issues or are
  seeking updates, we recommend exploring alternative solutions or resources
  that align with your requirements.

  Should you have any further questions or inquiries, please feel free to
  get in touch.
